# About the qDai chain

The qDai chain is an experimental chain built on top of [the Quorum blockchain platform. ](https://www.goquorum.com/)[A special patch was applied](https://github.com/poanetwork/quorum/commit/0e922bd8412b2c2019624c82a2b129f5f580d8c2) to the Quorum go-client to support [a Block Reward contract](https://openethereum.github.io/wiki/Block-Reward-Contract). This feature initially appeared in the Parity Ethereum client and allows flexible token minting.
