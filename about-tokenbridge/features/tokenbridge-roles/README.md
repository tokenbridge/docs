# TokenBridge Roles

Administrators on the TokenBridge are responsible for bridge security and upgrades. Every bridge has 2 sides - smart contracts are deployed on each side of the bridge. A side is referred to as either the Home \(or Native\) side or the Foreign side, depending on the bridge mode.

General information regarding the TokenBridge can be found in [Features & Definitions](../)

For detailed configuration options and bridge parameters see [xDai bridge contracts management](../../../xdai-bridge/xdai-bridge-contracts-management/)

### Multisignature requirements

Multisignature \(multisig\) wallet functionality is required for TokenBridge administrators. Multiple parties must agree on operations before an action is executed.

### Validator Roles
