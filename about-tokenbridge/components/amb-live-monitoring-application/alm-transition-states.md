# ALM transition states

## Foreign -> Home State Transitions

A request sent through an Arbitrary Message Bridge mediator from the Foreign chain can be in different states depending on the status of the bridge validators operations.

Below is a table with the description of possible states and clarifications what exactly this state means.

## Home -> Foreign State Transitions

Similar to requests sent from the Foreign chain, a request initiated from the Home chain also can be in different states. The number of states is larger since the bridge validators performs more operations to relay the request.

Below is a table with the description of possible states and clarifications what exactly this state means.

In Home -> Foreign transactions there are waiting/pending states for confirmation as well as for execution.
