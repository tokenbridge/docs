# About the qDai chain

The qDai chain is an experimental chain built on top of [the Quorum blockchain platform. ](https://www.goquorum.com)[A special patch was applied](https://github.com/poanetwork/quorum/commit/0e922bd8412b2c2019624c82a2b129f5f580d8c2) to the Quorum go-client to support [a Block Reward contract](https://openethereum.github.io/Block-Reward-Contract.html). This feature initially appeared in the Parity Ethereum client and allows flexible token minting.

**Key properties of the qDai chain:**

* Blocks produced every 1 second
* [Istanbul BFT](https://docs.goquorum.com/en/latest/Consensus/ibft/ibft/) consensus
* Block limit  `74'000'000` gas
* Gas price  `0`
* No block reward
* New native tokens (qDai) minted on Dai deposit (similar to [the xDai chain](https://www.xdaichain.com))
* Block Explorer and JSON rpc were available during testing but are not currently operational.
