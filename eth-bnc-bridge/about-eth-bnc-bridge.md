# About ETH-BNC bridge

The TokenBridge solution allows digital asset transfer between two Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based chains. Bridge operations are served by the TokenBridge oracles (Validators) - nodes that listen to user's relay requests. A user sends funds to a specific (bridge) account in one chain and formulates the relay request. Then, each validator node votes to approve the requested relay operation using a multisig wallet. As soon as enough votes are collected, the relay request is finalized and the corresponding asset amount is unlocked.

The [Binance Chain](https://docs.binance.org) does not support multisig wallets. However, the same voting functionality described above can be implemented with a [Threshold Signature Scheme](https://zengo.com/implementing-open-source-tss-to-binance-coin-bnb/) (TSS). A TSS uses Multiparty Computation to generate a digital signature of a message in a trustless manner, using a subset of validators.

The ETH-to-BNC bridge combines the TokenBridge approach with a TSS to approve relay operations and facilitate asset transfer between an EVM chain and the Binance chain.

The contracts and oracles are available on [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/poanetwork/eth-to-bnc-bridge).
