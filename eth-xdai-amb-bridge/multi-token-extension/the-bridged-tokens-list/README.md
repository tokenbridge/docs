A dynamic list with additional information is now available.

The OmniBridge multi-token bridge extension is now being used to bridge many tokens from Ethereum to xDai. A second instance bridges tokens to and from the Binance Smart Chain. When a token is bridged, the name is appended with _**on xDai**_. On a token page, you can also find the link to the original token on Ethereum. For more, see the [corresponding token contract addresses page](../correspondence-of-bridgeable-tokens.md).
