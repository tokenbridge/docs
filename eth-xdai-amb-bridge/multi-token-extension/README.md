# ðŸŒ‰ OmniBridge Extension

The OmniBridge multi-token extension for the Arbitrary Message Bridge between Ethereum and the xDai chain is the simplest way to transfer **ANY** ERC20/ERC677/ERC827 token to the xDai chain.

{% hint style="info" %}
An AMB bridge extension is a pair of mediator contracts associated with a specific pair of Arbitrary Message Bridge contracts.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
* List of the tokens already bridged through the extension is available [here](the-bridged-tokens-list/)
* [OmniBridge UI](https://omni.xdaichain.com)&#x20;
* Follow the [How to transfer tokens](how-to-transfer-tokens.md) section to perform operations
* [Security Audit Completed](../../about-tokenbridge/security-audits.md#tokenbridge-audit-by-quantstamp-covers-omnibridge).
{% endhint %}

By using this extension any user (not only the token contract owner) can transfer tokens from Ethereum to a chain with fast, inexpensive transactions (in this case the xDai chain) without deploying any additional contracts. The specified token amount is locked in the mediator contract, a new token contract is deployed automatically on the xDai chain, and the requested token amount is minted on the xDai chain. The reverse operation burns bridgeable tokens on the xDai chain and unlocks the tokens from the token contract on Ethereum.

### Transfer limits

Transfer limits are configured per a particular pair of tokens.

**Default limits:**

Default limits to transfer assets **from Ethereum to the xDai chain**:

* Daily limit: 1'000'000'000'000'000'000 tokens
* Maximum per transaction: 1'000'000'000 tokens
* Minimum per transaction: 0.0001 token

Default limits to transfer assets **from the xDai chain to Ethereum**

* Daily limit: 1'000'000'000'000'000'000 tokens
* Maximum per transaction: 1'000'000'000 tokens
* Minimum per transaction: 1 token

Fees are also configurable per a particular pair of tokens.

**Default fees:**

* There are no fees (except gas fees for the originating transaction) to transfer assets from the Ethereum to the xDai chain.
* The fee to transfer assets (besides gas fees for the originating transaction) from the xDai chain to Ethereum is **0.1%**.
