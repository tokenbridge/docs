# Using the xDai Bridge

### Basic operations

Instructions for usage with the UI are available on the xdaichain.com site

* [Moving Dai to xDai](https://www.xdaichain.com/for-users/converting-xdai-via-bridge/moving-dai-to-xdai)
* [Moving xDai to Dai](https://www.xdaichain.com/for-users/converting-xdai-via-bridge/moving-xdai-to-dai)

The bridge can also be used without the UI. [Instructions are here](how-to-use-xdai-bridge-without-ui.md).

### Advanced operations

It is possible to move Dai to xDai and back to an alternative receiver by calling the bridge methods directly how it is presented in [this manual](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/xdai-bridge/using-the-xdai-bridge/alternative-receiver-for-the-xdai-bridge).
