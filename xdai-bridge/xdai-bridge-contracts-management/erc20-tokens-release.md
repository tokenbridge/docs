# ERC20 Tokens Release

{% hint style="info" %}
The instructions use [NiftyWallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nifty-wallet/jbdaocneiiinmjbjlgalhcelgbejmnid) to invoke contract methods. An example how to use this functionality is available [here](https://medium.com/poa-network/nifty-wallet-now-supports-interactions-with-smart-contracts-5e8c43c19e3a)

Any tool that can create transactions based on contract source code or the ABI may be used.
{% endhint %}

1. Use the `claimTokens` method from `ForeignBridgeErcToNative` or `HomeBridgeErcToNative` ABI, an address of an ERC20 token contract, and receiver of the tokens to encode the data for the transaction. Example of the data: `69ffa08a0000000000000000000000000dcd2f752394c41875e259e00bb44fd505297caf000000000000000000000000583031d1113ad414f02576bd6afabfb302140225`.
2. Use NiftyWallet to invoke `submitTransaction` of the multisig wallet contract (`0xff1a8EDA5eAcdB6aAf729905492bdc6376DBe2dd` on the Mainnet ETH, `0x0d3726e5a9f37234d6b55216fc971d30f150a60f` on the xDai chain). The destination must be either `0x4aa42145Aa6Ebf72e164C9bBC74fbD3788045016` if the token contract is on the ETH Mainnet or `0x7301cfa0e1756b71869e93d4e4dca5c7d0eb0aa6` if the token contract is on the xDai chain. The data field must be filled with the bytes received on the previous step.&#x20;
3. Identify the index of the transaction returned in the `Submission` event as soon as the transaction from the previous step included into a block and share it with other multisig wallet owners.
4. (for the rest of owners) Use NiftyWallet  to invoke `confirmTransaction` of the multisig wallet contract (`0xff1a8EDA5eAcdB6aAf729905492bdc6376DBe2dd` on the Mainnet ETH, `0x0d3726e5a9f37234d6b55216fc971d30f150a60f` on the xDai chain). Set the gas limit three times bigger than the gas estimator suggests. &#x20;
