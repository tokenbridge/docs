# ERC677 to ERC677 AMB bridge extension

Instructions for deploying a pair of ERC677-compatible tokens and the bridge mediator contract on top of the Arbitrary Message Bridge (AMB).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**An AMB bridge extension** is a pair of mediator contracts associated with a specific pair of Arbitrary Message Bridge contracts.
{% endhint %}

The steps below assume that the AMB is up and running and serves [the bridge between Kovan (Foreign) chain and Sokol (Home) chain](../kovan-sokol-amb-bridge/about-the-kovan-sokol-amb/).

## Instructions

1. `docker pull poanetwork/tokenbridge-contracts:latest`\

2. Deploy an ERC20 token contract to the Foreign (Kovan) chain. The contract `PermittableToken` (`PermittableToken_flat.sol`) from the archive `tokenbridge-contracts-flattened-...zip` located on [the release page in the TokenBridge contracts repo](https://github.com/poanetwork/tokenbridge-contracts/releases/latest) can be used for this. The deployment can be performed with Remix or MyEtherWallet.\
   _**Note: **In the steps below we assume that the address of the deployed token contract is _`0xff94183659f549D6273349696d73686Ee1d2AC83`.\
   \
   Verify the contract in the block explorer (contract name: `PermittableToken`, compiler version: `v0.4.24+commit.e67f0147`, optimization is enabled, automatic identification of constructor arguments).\

3. Mint some amount of tokens for an account.\

4.  Create `amb-erc20-to-erc677.config` config file with the following content:

    ```
    # The type of bridge. Defines set of contracts to be deployed.
    BRIDGE_MODE=AMB_ERC_TO_ERC

    # The api key of the explorer api, if required, used to verify all
    # the deployed contracts in Foreign network.
    FOREIGN_EXPLORER_API_KEY=YOUR-ETHERSCAN-API-KEY-HERE

    ```

    _**Please note:**_ if `HOME_EXPLORER_URL`, `FOREIGN_EXPLORER_URL` and `FOREIGN_EXPLORER_API_KEY` are not configured, it will be necessary to verify the contracts in the block explorers manually. The flattened contracts sources from the archive `tokenbridge-contracts-flattened-...zip` located on [the release page in the TokenBridge contracts repo](https://github.com/poanetwork/tokenbridge-contracts/releases/latest) can be used for this. _It is highly recommended to allow the deployment process to verify the contracts automatically since the verification could be not trivial and take lots of steps._\

5.  `docker run -ti --rm --env-fileamb-erc20-to-erc677.config`

    ` poanetwork/tokenbridge-contracts:latest deploy.sh`\
    Output will look similar to this:

    ```
    Deployment has been completed.

    {
        "homeBridge": {
            "homeBridgeMediator": {
                "address": "0x8f33Ad10fdc10B56D4d4Ca09D5A5910D62d82375"
            },
            "bridgeableErc677": {
                "address": "0xB36296478099555f9a2AD45AeA6E7b6c82DCc56d"
            }
        },
        "foreignBridge": {
            "foreignBridgeMediator": {
                "address": "0xC3C5dcCeB4276aEd47c2129B2F3906Ec66803361"
            }
        }
    }

    ```
6. If `HOME_EXPLORER_URL`, `FOREIGN_EXPLORER_URL` and `FOREIGN_EXPLORER_API_KEY` were not configured, verify the sources in the block explorers. Otherwise, skip this step.\

7. If your own ERC20 token was used in the configuration for the extension, execute the `approve` method on the token contract on the Foreign side as so the approved address is the mediator contract `0xC3C5dcCeB4276aEd47c2129B2F3906Ec66803361`. Then invoke the `relayTokens` method on the mediator contract. Note that for these two operations the amount of tokens must be equal or greater the `FOREIGN_MIN_AMOUNT_PER_TX` parameter used in the deployment.\
   \
   If the `PermittableToken` contract was used for the token on the foreign side, invoke `transferAndCall` method from the token contract. The argument `to` for the call must contain the address of the mediator contract `0xC3C5dcCeB4276aEd47c2129B2F3906Ec66803361`. The `data` argument must be `0x`. \
   \
   For both cases the sender of the transaction is used as the account to receive the tokens on another side of the bridge.\
   \
   The transaction hash can be used [on the AMB Live monitoring app](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/about-tokenbridge/components/amb-live-monitoring-application) to track the status of the transfer confirmation and execution.\

8. The method `transferAndCall` can be used with the token contract (`0xB36296478099555f9a2AD45AeA6E7b6c82DCc56d`) on the Home side to transfer tokens back to the Foreign chain. The argument `to` for the call must contain the address of the mediator contract `0x8f33Ad10fdc10B56D4d4Ca09D5A5910D62d82375`. The `data` argument must be `0x`.&#x20;
