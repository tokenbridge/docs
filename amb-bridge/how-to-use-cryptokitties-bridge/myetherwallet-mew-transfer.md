# MyEtherWallet (MEW) Transfer

## **Transfer a Cat from Kovan to Sokol **

{% hint style="info" %}
You will need a small amount of KETH to complete the transfer.  You can obtain here: [https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet](https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
In this tutorial we use MetaMask to connect to MyEtherWallet(MEW). Some processes may not work using a different connection method.
{% endhint %}

### 1) Login to [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com) using MetaMask and switch to the Kovan Network.

![Login to MEW with MetaMask](<../../.gitbook/assets/mm1 (1).png>)

![Switch to Kovan in MetaMask](../../.gitbook/assets/kov1.png)

You will now be connected to Kovan (KOV) through Metamask.

### 2) Approve the token you will transfer with the bridge

* Open a second browser tab to view[ the KittyCore contract in Blockscout](https://blockscout.com/eth/kovan/address/0x13ac5c6338796a31a39e74d70b0153c1be5f53b4/contracts).&#x20;
  * If you deployed your own contract, use the \[ Foreign ] kittyCore: `0x........` address from [deployment step 6 here](deploy-cryptokitty-contracts.md#6-deploy-contracts).
* Go to the **Code** tab, **scroll down** below the Contract Source Code, and copy the Contract ABI code.

![Copy the Contract ABI](<../../.gitbook/assets/contract\_abi (1).png>)

* Back in MEW, select **Contract** from the left hand menu (you may need to expand your browser window to see) and enter:
  * 1\) Example Contract Address:  `0x13ac5c6338796a31a39e74d70b0153c1be5f53b4` (if you deployed a contracts, this will be your KittyCore address)
  * 2\) Copied ABI to the ABI/JSON interface text area.
  * 3\) Click **Continue**

![Copy in Contract Address and ABI then press Continue](<../../.gitbook/assets/abi (1).png>)

* In the Read/Write Contract Interface
  * 1\) choose the `approve` method from the **Select an Item** dropdown menu. If you deployed your own contracts, the \_toaddress will be the \[ Foreign ] foreignMediator: `0x........` address from [deployment step 6 here](deploy-cryptokitty-contracts.md#6-deploy-contracts).
  * 2\)**  \_to(address):** `0x7dB6493D9B6D99D9A240a6914AdAd5e0E8E8BE40`
  * 3\) **\_tokenId**: insert the Id of the token you own that you want to transfer to Sokol.&#x20;
  * 4\) **Value in Eth:** Keep at 0
  * 5\) Press `Write`

![Choose the approve method and enter in the contract address and tokenID](../../.gitbook/assets/interact.png)

* After the success message, confirm the transaction in MetaMask. Once confirmed, Press** Back** in the MEW interface.

### &#x20;  3)  Initiate the token transfer:

* Open a second browser tab to view [Mediator contract in BlockScout](https://blockscout.com/eth/kovan/address/0xa58728538b77680f303e07d418259a68d3e66991/contracts). **Scroll down** below the Contract Source Code and **copy the Contract ABI code**.
* Add the contract to MEW
  * 1\) Contract Address:  `0x7db6493d9b6d99d9a240a6914adad5e0e8e8be40` (foreignMediator proxy contract address)
  * 2\) Copied ABI to the ABI/JSON interface text area.
  * 3\) Click **Continue**

![Mediator contract address and ABI code](../../.gitbook/assets/tt22.png)

* In the Read/Write Contract Interface
  * 1\) Execute the `transferToken` method from the dropdown menu
  * 2\)  **\_from** : paste **your account address **(can copy from MetaMask)
  * 3\) **\_tokenId:** insert the Id of the token you own
  * 4\) **Value in Eth:** 0
  * 5\) Press `Write` and complete the transaction confirmation through MetaMask

![Add values and Write to intiate transfer to Sokol](../../.gitbook/assets/interact2.png)

As soon as the transaction is confirmed,  the token will be locked in the Mediator contract in Kovan (example: `0x7db6493d9b6d99d9a240a6914adad5e0e8e8be40`). [Check Token Holders here](https://blockscout.com/eth/kovan/tokens/0x13ac5c6338796a31a39e74d70b0153c1be5f53b4/token\_holders).

After waiting several seconds to allow for AMB bridge operations, check the [token contract on Sokol](https://blockscout.com/poa/sokol/tokens/0xc6a592ED792de33e6CBBF7ce04Dd9D3884B46B9A/inventory) to confirm the bridge token is minted on Sokol with the same Id and metadata

## **Transfer Cat from Sokol to Kovan**

{% hint style="info" %}
The process is identical to the above process other than  using different contract addresses.&#x20;

You can get Sokol Test Tokens here: [https://faucet-sokol.herokuapp.com/](https://faucet-sokol.herokuapp.com)
{% endhint %}

1. Make sure that you are on the Sokol network in MEW
2. Approve the token to be transferred by the bridge:
   * Visit [the Kitties contract in Blockscout](https://blockscout.com/poa/sokol/address/0xc6a592ED792de33e6CBBF7ce04Dd9D3884B46B9A/contracts), go to the **Code **tab and copy ABI there.
   * Add the contract to MEW by using this example address (or your **SimpleBridgeKitty **contract address**) **`0xc6a592ED792de33e6CBBF7ce04Dd9D3884B46B9A` and copied ABI.
   * Make a transaction to execute the `approve` method
     * &#x20;`_to` parameter:`0x7dB6493D9B6D99D9A240a6914AdAd5e0E8E8BE40`, in `_tokenId` parameter insert the Id of the token you want to transfer.&#x20;
     * Press `Write` and confirm the transaction confirmation.
3. Initiate the token transfer:
   * Visit in another browser tab [the Mediator contract in Blockscout](https://blockscout.com/poa/sokol/address/0x521211789711e7048e900d16310e1de940b1e53b/contracts) and scroll down to copy the ABI
   * Add the contract to MEW by using the address (or your homeMediator proxy contract address)`0x5EeC77239398FE328791E28700CAFddB2990ea97` and copied ABI.
   * Make a transaction to execute the `transferToken` method
     * &#x20;`_from` parameter paste the address **of your account** that will receive the token on the other network
     * &#x20;`_tokenId` parameter insert the Id of the token you want to transfer.&#x20;
     * Press `Write` and confirm the transaction confirmation.

When the token is transferred in the opposite direction, it is **burned in Sokol** and unlocked on Kovan. After waiting a couple of seconds to allow the AMB bridge operations, check the [token contract on Kovan](https://blockscout.com/eth/kovan/tokens/0x13AC5C6338796a31A39e74D70B0153C1bE5f53B4/inventory) to see that the token bridged is now owned by your account again (rather than the contract) with the same ID and metadata as before.
