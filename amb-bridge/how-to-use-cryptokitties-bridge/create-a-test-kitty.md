# Create/Transfer a Test Cat

{% hint style="warning" %}
&#x20;If you would like to try transferring a cat with the bridge **without creating your own test cat**, please contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/mPJ9zkq) or the [TokenBridge forum ](https://forum.poa.network/c/tokenbridge/)with your wallet address, and we will send you a test cat to play with :heart\_eyes\_cat:. &#x20;

With a test cat, you can proceed from [NiftyWallet Transfer](niftywallet-transfer.md) or [MEW transfer](myetherwallet-mew-transfer.md) instructions.

## Test Cat Creation Instruction

If you deployed your own contracts and have access to the ownership address, you can also create a test cat using the **createPromoKitty** method in the **KittyCore** contract.
