# NiftyWallet Transfer

## **Transfer Cat: Kovan to Sokol**

{% hint style="info" %}
You will need a small amount of KETH to complete the transfer process.  You can obtain here: [https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet](https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
In order to follow the process with your own kitties, you must first [deploy your own contracts](https://app.gitbook.com/@poa/s/tokenbridge/\~/edit/drafts/-LrL6654d2nfg9pCMDSD/amb-bridge/deploy-cryptokitty-contracts) and use those contract addresses here.
{% endhint %}

### 1) Log into your wallet through the [Nifty wallet chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nifty-wallet/jbdaocneiiinmjbjlgalhcelgbejmnid).&#x20;

Note: This should be the owner wallet address if you followed the deployment process.

### 2) Select the Kovan Test Network.

![Select Kovan Test Network](../../.gitbook/assets/kovan\_1.png)

### 3) Add **KittyCore** contract

*   Copy the contract address.\
    In our example we use our example KittyCore contract address `0x13AC5C6338796a31A39e74D70B0153C1bE5f53B4 `. If you deployed your own contract, use the \[ Foreign ] kittyCore: `0x........` address from [deployment step 5](deploy-cryptokitty-contracts.md#5-deploy-your-contracts) here.

    &#x20;
* In Nifty Wallet:
  * 1\) Open accounts menu and scroll to the bottom
  * 2\) Click on `Import Account`

![Open Accounts menu and import new account](<../../.gitbook/assets/imported (1).png>)

* **Select Type:** `Contract`&#x20;
  *   1\) paste in the contract address`0x13AC5C6338796a31A39e74D70B0153C1bE5f53B4`

      &#x20;The ABI will be fetched automatically.
  * 2\) Click **Import**

![Select Contract Type and paste in contract address. ABI will populate automatically.](<../../.gitbook/assets/import\_2 (2).png>)

* It is useful to edit the name of the imported contract.&#x20;
  * 1\) For example rename to `KittyCore`. Hover over the created name (Account #) and edit text will appear. Click on **edit **and** **change the name
  * 2\) click** Save**.

![Rename the contract to KittyCore](<../../.gitbook/assets/kittycore (2).png>)

### 4) Add Mediator (Proxy) contract

* Copy the contract address: `0x7dB6493D9B6D99D9A240a6914AdAd5e0E8E8BE40`.  &#x20;
  * If you deployed your own contract, use the \[ Foreign ] Mediator: `0x........` address from [deployment step 5](deploy-cryptokitty-contracts.md#5-deploy-your-contracts) here.
* Enter `Import Account` section
* **Select Type: **`Proxy` as type and paste the address of the contract
* After ABI is loaded, click **Import**.
* Rename contract if desired. We rename to `Mediator_k`.

Now that we have the token and mediator contracts available, we will perform 2 transactions to transfer the token from Kovan to Sokol.  First, call the `approve` method of the token contract,  then call the `transferToken` of mediator contract.

### 5) Approve Method of Token (KittyCore) Contract

* Select KittyCore contract in Nifty Wallet and click  `Execute methods` button

![KittyCore Contract](../../.gitbook/assets/execute\_methods.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
You must own the token you are attempting to transfer. You cannot transfer a token owned by another address.
{% endhint %}

* 1\) Select the `approve` method
* 2\) in `_to` parameter, paste the mediator contract address. If you deployed your own contracts, you will use the  (\[ Foreign ] Mediator  `0x.........`  address)\
  Example:`0x7dB6493D9B6D99D9A240a6914AdAd5e0E8E8BE40`&#x20;
* 3\) in `_tokenId` parameter insert the Id of the token you want to transfer. You can see the tokenIDs you own in the [View Kitties in BlockScout](view-in-blockscout.md) instructions.
* 4\)  Click **Next**

![Select the approve method and enter in the mediator contract address and \_tokenId](../../.gitbook/assets/approve.png)

* Select the wallet account that will send the transaction. **This must be sent with the account that owns the token.**

![Select account that owns the token to send the transaction](../../.gitbook/assets/select\_account.png)

* Submit the transaction and wait until it is mined.

### 6) TransferToken Method of Mediator\_k Contract

Now let's call `transferToken` to make the transfer and bridge the token.

* Select Mediator\_k contract on Nifty Wallet and click the `Execute methods` button.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/execute\_methods2.png)

* 1\) Select `transferToken` method
* 2\) in `_from` parameter paste the address of your account (same as original ownership address) that will receive the token on the other network
* 3\) in `_tokenId` parameter insert the Id of the token you want to transfer

{% hint style="warning" %}
You must transfer the token to the **same wallet address on the other network**. You cannot transfer between accounts, the account address must be the same, and the token id must match the id of your owned token.
{% endhint %}

* 4\) Click **Next**

![Mediator contract parameters](../../.gitbook/assets/execution.png)

* Select the account that will send the transaction. **This can be any account **that contains the required amount of KETH to complete the transaction.
* Submit the transaction and wait until it is mined.

Now the token is locked in the Mediator contract in Kovan. Allow a few seconds to process the transaction, then check the [token contract on Sokol](https://blockscout.com/poa/sokol/tokens/0xc6a592ED792de33e6CBBF7ce04Dd9D3884B46B9A/inventory) to see that the token is minted with the same ID and Metadata.

![Token added to Sokol](../../.gitbook/assets/15.png)

![In the Read Contract tab, you can select the getKitty method to show Kitty MetaData](<../../.gitbook/assets/readcontract (1).png>)

## **Transfer Cat: Sokol to Kovan**

The process is similar when transferring from Sokol back to Kovan.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You can get Sokol Test Tokens here: [https://faucet-sokol.herokuapp.com/](https://faucet-sokol.herokuapp.com)
{% endhint %}

Select **Sokol Test Network** on Nifty Wallet

### 1) Add **SimpleBridgeKitty** contract

* Copy the contract address: `0xc6a592ED792de33e6CBBF7ce04Dd9D3884B46B9A`
* On Nifty Wallet click on `Import Account` menu
* Select `Contract` as type and paste the address of the contract.&#x20;
* Click **Import**
* It is useful to edit the name of the imported contract to for example `SimpleBridgeKitty`

### &#x20;2) Add Mediator contract

* Copy the contract address: `0x5EeC77239398FE328791E28700CAFddB2990ea97`
* Enter `Import Account` section
* Select `Proxy` as type and paste the address of the contract
* After ABI is loaded, click on Import button.

Again, two transactions are needed to bridge the token back to Kovan

### 3) Approve Method of Token (SimpleBridgeKitty) Contract

Follow the steps explained above to call `approve` method of the token contract.&#x20;

* On `_to` parameter paste the mediator contract address `0x5EeC77239398FE328791E28700CAFddB2990ea97`
* In `_tokenId` parameter insert the Id of the token you want to transfer. **Send transaction with the account where you own the Cat**.

### 4) TransferToken Method of Mediator Contract&#x20;

Follow the explained steps to call `transferToken` of mediator contract.&#x20;

* On `_from` parameter paste the address of your account (**same account where Cat is owned on Sokol**) that will receive the token on the other network
* In `_tokenId` parameter insert the Id of the token you want to transfer.

### Success!

In this case the token is burned in Sokol. After waiting several seconds to allow the AMB bridge perform operations we can check the [token contract on Kovan](https://blockscout.com/eth/kovan/tokens/0x13AC5C6338796a31A39e74D70B0153C1bE5f53B4/inventory) and see that the bridged token is now owned by your account again with the same ID and metadata as before.
